# yapslackbot

Yet Another Python Slackbot

## Features

* Written in python3 using Flask, Flask-Dance, and gunicorn
* Handles OAuth so that it can be installed as a "real" Slack application
* Configuration via a config file
* Simple plugin architecture to make it easy to add your own capabilities

## Credits

I used [singingwolfboy](https://github.com/singingwolfboy/flask-dance-slack)'s code to make the OAuth dance fly.
